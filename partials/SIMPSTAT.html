"""Sergey has made N measurements. Now, he wants to know the average value of the measurements made.

In order to make the average value a better representative of the measurements, before calculating
the average, he wants first to remove the highest K and the lowest K measurements. After that, he
will calculate the average value among the remaining N - 2K measurements.

Could you help Sergey to find the average value he will get after these manipulations?

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description
of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K denoting the number
of measurements and the number of the greatest and the lowest values that will be removed.

The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the measurements.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the average value after removing K lowest and K
greatest measurements.

Your answer will be considered correct, in case it has absolute or relative error, not exceeding 10-6.
